# Automating-Trading-from-basic-to-advanced-
This GitHub repository is about my journey on learning how to automate trade on a paper account from Alpaca. I will be updating everything here as I keep learning. 

INDEX
1. Trading-1: buying a share via Python code
Description: I created a paper trading account on Alpaca. Downloaded the API on my PC and started writing code. Tried buying one share but didn't realize that it was already 2am here (I'm kinda zone-out sometimes hehe). The order didn't execute but the code ran without any errors and the latter one shows that the market is closed as well.
EDIT: Logged in the next day and was able to buy 6 shares of Apple (AAPL) and 3 shares of Meta (META)

2. Trading-2: Optimizing 

[WILL KEEP UPDATING.. ]

INDEX for DOCS:
1. Basics of Quantitative Trading: 
This doc includes all the basics of Quant trading that you would need to understand the history, and ideology behind the advent of Quant Trading. In addition, you will also be able to understand the complex programs and strategies that quants deploy to trade in millisecond time ranges (also called HFT quants), etc.
